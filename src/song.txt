"Stalker's Tango" - Autoheart

I know, I know, I know, this situation's strange
It takes a little getting, a little getting used to

Love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me more
Than you possibly can

It's not that complicated
No matter what they say
You'll never meet another me
It's not that difficult
To get your head around
You'll never meet another me
You'll never, never, ever, never, ever meet another me

I know, I know, I know, I'm always in your place
But don't you see, my dear?
I am your doppelganger
I have your face, so

Love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me more
Than you possibly can

It's not that complicated
No matter what they say
You'll never meet another me
It's not that difficult
To get your head around
You'll never meet another me
You'll never, never, never, ever, ever meet another me

[instrumental with vocalizations]

It's not that complicated
No matter what they say
I'll never meet another you
It's not that difficult
To get my head around
I'll never meet another you
